# AGENT 2: JD ANALYSIS & ALIGNMENT

## PURPOSE
Analyze job description requirements and create alignment map showing Jeremy's fit.

## TIMING
- Run after Agent 1
- Target: 2 minutes, ~200 tokens
- Apply Executive Hiring Manager lens

## PROCESS

### Step 1: Extract Requirements
From JD, identify:
- **Must-have requirements** (deal-breakers)
- **Nice-to-have requirements** (preferred)
- **Soft skills** (leadership, communication, etc.)
- **Technical skills**
- **Experience requirements** (years, industries, etc.)

### Step 2: Alignment Assessment
For each requirement, assess Jeremy's alignment:

✅ **STRONG MATCH** - Direct experience, can prove it
△ **PARTIAL MATCH** - Related experience, needs positioning
✗ **GAP** - No direct experience, need mitigation strategy

### Step 3: Gap Strategy
For each gap:
- Can we position related experience as transferable?
- Is this actually required or just preferred?
- Can we address in cover letter vs resume?
- Should we skip this role?

### Step 4: Keyword Extraction
Extract and prioritize keywords by:
- Frequency in JD
- Placement (title, requirements, nice-to-have)
- Relevance to Jeremy's background
