# TRIPLE LENS FRAMEWORK

## PURPOSE
Every resume decision must pass through three perspectives to ensure quality, accuracy, and strategic positioning.

---

## LENS 1: RESUME CONSULTANT
**Role:** Technical expert ensuring defensibility

**Key Question:** "Can Jeremy defend this claim in an interview?"

**Checks for:**
- Factual accuracy (numbers, dates, titles)
- Defensible achievements (no fabrication)
- Appropriate scope claims (led vs participated)
- Verifiable metrics
- Consistent terminology

**Red flags:**
- Exaggerated scope ("enterprise-wide" when it was one function)
- Inflated numbers
- Claiming credit for team/partner work
- Vague metrics ("significant," "substantial")

**Pass criteria:** Jeremy can explain and defend every bullet point when questioned.

---

## LENS 2: EXECUTIVE HIRING MANAGER
**Role:** Busy executive scanning resumes quickly

**Key Question:** "Does this grab my attention in 10 seconds?"

**Checks for:**
- Clear value proposition in summary
- Executive-level language
- Quantified impact ($ and % preferred)
- Scale indicators (team size, budget, scope)
- Strategic positioning vs tactical details

**Red flags:**
- Buried accomplishments
- IC-level language for executive role
- Missing quantification
- Too much detail on tools/tech
- Weak summary that doesn't sell

**Pass criteria:** A VP/C-suite executive would request an interview based on this resume.

---

## LENS 3: SOUNDBOARD / THINKING PARTNER
**Role:** Strategic advisor challenging assumptions

**Key Question:** "What could make this stronger?"

**Checks for:**
- Optimal bullet order (leadership first?)
- Strongest positioning for target role
- Gap mitigation strategies
- Competitive differentiation
- Missing opportunities

**Red flags:**
- Generic positioning (could be anyone)
- Not tailored to target role
- Defensive language
- Missing obvious connections
- Underselling achievements

**Pass criteria:** This is the strongest possible positioning given Jeremy's actual experience.

## DECISION EXAMPLES

**Scenario: Should we say "led 30+ professionals" or "managed team of 30"?**
- **Lens 1:** Both accurate ✓
- **Lens 2:** "Led" is more executive than "managed" ✓
- **Lens 3:** "30+ professionals" sounds bigger than "team of 30" ✓
- **Decision:** Use "led 30+ professionals"

**Scenario: Should we include a 6-month contract role?**
- **Lens 1:** It's accurate, can defend it ✓
- **Lens 2:** Might raise "job hopper" concern ✗
- **Lens 3:** Adds consulting experience, shows versatility ✓
- **Decision:** Include if relevant to target role, skip if not

**Scenario: Can we say "drove AI transformation"?**
- **Lens 1:** Jeremy developed strategy, didn't implement - can't defend "transformation" ✗
- **Lens 2:** "Transformation" sounds impressive but misleading ✗
- **Lens 3:** "Developed AI strategy" is honest and still strong ✓
- **Decision:** Use "developed AI strategy and operational roadmap"

---

## INTEGRATION WITH AGENT WORKFLOW

**Agent 0 (Supervisor):** Enforces that all agents apply appropriate lenses

**Agent 1 (Company Intelligence):** Uses Lens 2 + 3 for positioning strategy

**Agent 2 (JD Analysis):** Uses Lens 2 + 3 for hiring manager perspective

**Agent 3 (Draft):** Uses all 3 lenses throughout creation

**Agent 4 (Accuracy):** Primarily Lens 1, some Lens 3

**Agent 5 (Read):** Primarily Lens 1 + 3

**Agent 6 (Voice):** Primarily Lens 2

**Agent 7 (ATS):** Technical check, no lens needed

**Agent 8 (Cover Letter):** Uses all 3 lenses

---

## RESOLVING LENS CONFLICTS

**When lenses disagree:**

**Lens 1 (Accuracy) ALWAYS wins.**
- If you can't defend it, don't claim it
- Accuracy is non-negotiable
- Better to undersell than fabricate

**Between Lens 2 and 3:**
- Lens 2 wins for attention-grabbing (summary, top bullets)
- Lens 3 wins for strategic positioning (overall approach)
- Balance: Executive appeal + strategic fit

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **All three lenses must approve before presenting to user**
2. **Lens 1 has veto power - accuracy trumps everything**
3. **Lenses are cumulative - each adds a layer of quality**
4. **Don't skip lenses to save time - they prevent mistakes**
5. **When in doubt, ask user before proceeding**

---

## EXAMPLES IN PRACTICE

**Bad (fails Lens 1):**
"Led enterprise-wide AI transformation delivering $50M in value"
- **Lens 1:** Can't defend "enterprise-wide" or "$50M" ✗

**Better (passes all lenses):**
"Developed AI operational roadmap and delivery framework for commercial platforms, establishing foundation for enterprise adoption"
- **Lens 1:** Accurate and defensible ✓
- **Lens 2:** Shows strategic thinking ✓
- **Lens 3:** Positions for growth into bigger role ✓

---

**The three lenses ensure every resume is accurate, attention-grabbing, and strategically positioned.**
