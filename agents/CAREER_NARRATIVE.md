# CAREER NARRATIVE & POSITIONING INSIGHTS

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

This document captures positioning strategies, interview learnings, and context that informs resume creation but isn't purely factual data for Quick Reference.

================================================================================
## JEREMY'S LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

### Core Philosophy Statement

"I believe sustainable organizational transformation happens through consistent, small changes over time rather than dramatic overhauls. My approach focuses on building trust and psychological safety first, then gradually shifting teams from order-taking to entrepreneurial thinking. I emphasize partnership-based collaboration between business and technology teams, moving beyond traditional vendor-client relationships toward shared value creation. Modern organizations succeed when they adopt product-centric delivery models where teams have autonomy to solve problems rather than just execute requests."

### Foundation Principle: People & Process Before Technology

**Core Belief:**
"People and Process are ALWAYS the first things to focus on in ANYTHING requiring significant investment. This requires building trust between IT and everyone else."

**What This Means in Practice:**
1. Technology doesn't solve organizational problems - people do
2. Process improvement enables technology adoption
3. Trust must be established before transformation can happen
4. Business partnership beats technical perfection
5. People-first leadership creates sustainable change

### Trust-Building Approach

**NOT Working in a Vacuum:**
- Traditional IT people work in silos - Jeremy explicitly avoids this
- Constant collaboration with business stakeholders
- Transparent communication about constraints and possibilities
- Honest conversations about gaps and limitations
- Building relationships before asking for support

**How Trust Gets Built:**
1. Listen first, prescribe second
2. Deliver small wins early
3. Be transparent about risks and challenges
4. Follow through on commitments
5. Speak business language, not just technical
6. Admit when you don't know something
7. Give credit to the team, take blame as leader

**Results of Trust-Building:**
- Business gives flexibility for tech debt sprints
- Executive leadership supports long-term investments
- Teams feel safe to experiment and fail
- Cross-functional collaboration improves
- Technology becomes business partner, not cost center

### "Not Order-Takers" Philosophy

**What This Means:**
- IT exists to enable business outcomes, not execute tasks
- Engineering should challenge requirements when needed
- Partnership means joint problem-solving
- Proactive suggestions, not reactive execution
- Strategic advisory, not just implementation

**How This Gets Implemented:**
- "Why are we doing this?" is always valid question
- Technology teams empowered to propose alternatives
- Business requirements are starting point for discussion
- Solutions emerge from collaboration, not dictation
- Focus on outcomes, not just outputs

### Organizational Transformation Approach

**Small Changes Compound Over Time:**
Jeremy rejects "big bang" transformation approaches in favor of iterative improvement. Small wins build momentum, trust, and organizational capacity for change.

**The Transformation Playbook:**

**Phase 1: Trust & Assessment (Months 1-3)**
- Listen before prescribing solutions
- Acknowledge past failures without blame
- Build psychological safety
- Identify quick wins for credibility

**Phase 2: Operating Model Redesign (Months 4-9)**
- Introduce product-centric thinking gradually
- Establish OKR planning cycles
- Create cross-functional collaboration structures
- Build vendor governance

**Phase 3: Delivery Acceleration (Months 10-24)**
- Scale what's working; adjust what isn't
- Implement Agile ceremonies and practices
- Build reusable components and patterns
- Establish knowledge management

**Phase 4: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)**
- Retrospectives and learning loops
- Celebrate successes; analyze failures
- Expand successful patterns to new areas
- Mentor next generation of leaders

================================================================================
## CRITICAL WORKFLOW LESSONS
================================================================================

### ALWAYS USE PROVEN LANGUAGE FROM PREVIOUS RESUMES

**The Problem (GDIT VA CTO v1):**
Agent 3 tried to keyword-stuff from JD instead of using proven language from `/tmp/molex_vp_data_ai_final.md`:
- Fabricated "AWS" (never used)
- Added "Google Cloud" to competencies (never mentioned)
- Keyword stuffing: "demonstrating rapid prototyping and translating emerging technology into business outcomes"
- Generic competencies: "Cloud Platform Strategy" instead of specific "(Salesforce, Snowflake)"
- Too direct with disability: "70% disabled" in summary

**The Fix (GDIT VA CTO v2):**
Agent 3 started over using Molex VP Data as voice/style template:
- Used exact proven phrasing: "Directed 3-month initiative with core AI team..."
- Removed ALL fabrications (AWS, Google Cloud)
- Specific competencies: "Cloud Platform Architecture (Salesforce, Snowflake)"
- Strategic disability positioning: "Army veteran" in summary only, removed 70% entirely
- Clean, direct language from proven template

**The Lesson:**
- Agent 3 MUST read `/tmp/` resumes before creating new ones
- Use proven language that already passed validation
- Don't keyword-stuff to match JD - use accurate, grounded language
- Reference CAREER_NARRATIVE.md for positioning strategies
- When in doubt, copy phrasing that already worked

================================================================================
## CORE POSITIONING STRATEGIES
================================================================================

### INDUSTRY TRANSITIONS = ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET

**The Pattern:**
- Healthcare (11 years) → Consulting (18 months) → Manufacturing (2.5 years) → Next?
- Each transition shows learning agility, not job hopping

**Core Philosophy:**
"Technology is literally the same across everything industry - only 30% is industry-specific, 70% of knowledge transfers. I enter new domains, learn the mission, and deliver value."

**How to Frame:**
"At Molex, I had zero manufacturing background but delivered $27M in value. At AAH, I learned healthcare IT and delivered $53M over 10 years. Technology leadership skills are universal - you understand how all parts of technology meet business outcomes, then you learn the industry-specific 30%."

**Key Phrase:** 
"I like to grow organizations. I thrive in the grey area and chaos."

**Used Successfully In:**
- Jabil resume (manufacturing → energy infrastructure transition)
- Direct Supply resume (manufacturing → senior living tech)
- Multiple financial services applications

### VETERAN STATUS AS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**For VA/Veterans-Focused Roles:**
- Army Service: 2003-2006
- Disability Status: 70% disabled veteran
- VA Experience: 20 years as VA healthcare patient
- Unique Perspective: Understands VA frustrations from user perspective

**Positioning Strategy (Updated Feb 2026 - GDIT VA CTO):**
"As an Army veteran who's used VA healthcare for 20 years, I understand veteran challenges from the patient side - and I want to serve them through technology leadership."

**DO:**
- Use "Army veteran" in summary
- Emphasize 20 years as VA patient (shows lived experience)
- Focus on understanding veteran challenges from patient perspective
- Mission-driven language ("serve veterans through technology")

**DO NOT:**
- Put "70% disabled" in professional summary (too direct, not strategic)
- Include disability rating in Education section (not necessary)
- Lead with disability status
- Make it about personal situation vs mission

**Why This Works:**
- Most candidates have VA IT experience but NOT veteran lived experience
- Unique differentiator from typical candidates
- Mission-driven positioning (not just job-seeking)
- Turns "no VA IT experience" gap into competitive advantage

**Proven Summary Language:**
"I've spent 17+ years building and leading technology organizations that deliver measurable outcomes for mission-critical healthcare systems. As an Army veteran who's used VA healthcare for 20 years, I understand veteran challenges from the patient side - and I want to serve them through technology leadership."

### LARGE-SCALE INFLUENCE VS DIRECT MANAGEMENT

**The Reality:**
- Direct Management: 30+ at Molex (4 managers reporting), 10-15 at AAH
- Influenced/Coordinated: 100+ at AAH (Infrastructure, Networking, Application Engineering)
- Total IT Org Context: AAH grew from 1,000 → 1,700 IT employees post-merger

**How to Position for 100+ Team Roles:**
"At Advocate Aurora Health, I influenced across Infrastructure, Networking, and Application Engineering teams of 100+ professionals to deliver enterprise-wide technology initiatives within a 1,000+ person IT organization."

**Why This Matters:**
- When JD asks for "100+ team experience," can honestly claim influence at that scale
- Shows collaborative leadership without direct authority
- Demonstrates ability to operate in large, complex organizations
- Proves influence skills that often matter more than authority

**Used In:**
- Direct Supply VP Engineering resume
- GDIT Veterans Healthcare CTO resume
- Any large enterprise role applications

### OVERQUALIFIED POSITIONING

**The Problem:**
When applying for roles below experience level (App Manager when you have VP-level experience), hiring teams worry:
- You'll get frustrated and leave within 12-18 months
- You'll try to run the place and undermine current leadership
- You'll make current peers look bad by comparison
- You're using this as a stepping stone to something better

**How to Address Proactively (Interview):**
"I know my background shows VP-level experience and you might be wondering why I'm interested in [this role]. Here's the truth: I'm drawn to [Company]'s [mission/growth/technology]. I'd rather contribute at [Company] in a role where I can make immediate impact than chase a title somewhere else that doesn't excite me. I'm not here to remake your organization - I want to help execute YOUR vision."

**To Peers Specifically:**
"I'm here to collaborate with you, not compete. I see us as partners solving business problems together. I make my teammates look good - that's how I define leadership success."

**In Cover Letters (When Gap is Obvious):**
Use honest-but-confident framing: "My background is building technology teams across healthcare and manufacturing - I haven't led [specific function] before. What I have done is [relevant accomplishments]. That's what draws me to this role: the opportunity to apply these capabilities to [specific area]."

**Lesson Learned From:**
- Faith Technologies rejection (overqualified for App Manager, peer felt threatened)

### SERVANT LEADER VS "MY WAY OR HIGHWAY"

**The Challenge:**
Jeremy's direct communication style + passion + deep expertise can read as "I know the right way and I'll force it on you" even when that's not the intent.

**What Actually Works:**
- Lead with curiosity, not solutions
- Ask "Tell me about your current approach" BEFORE sharing yours  
- Acknowledge constraints: "Every company is different, I'd want to understand your context first"
- Use collaborative language: "We could explore..." vs "I would do..."
- Show you'll LISTEN before you LEAD

**Interview Approach (80/20 Rule):**
1. "Tell me about [current situation]..." (ask first) - 80% of time
2. They talk (listen actively, build on what they say)
3. "That's interesting. At [Company] we tried something similar..." (share as comparison, not prescription) - 20% of time
4. "How have you handled [related challenge]?" (stay curious)

**Language to Avoid:**
- "The right approach is..." (implies their approach is wrong)
- "Have you considered..." (implies they should have thought of it)
- "But..." (negates what came before)
- Jumping to solutions before understanding problems fully

**Order Matters:**
- 80% asking / 20% telling = collaborative partner
- 20% asking / 80% telling = "my way or highway"

**Energy Matters:**
- High energy about YOUR approach + flat when asking about THEIRS = red flag
- Equal energy for curiosity and expertise sharing = collaborative

**Lesson Learned From:**
- Faith Technologies final interview feedback
- Multiple interviews where passion was misread as rigidity

### HONEST GAP POSITIONING

**Philosophy:**
Address gaps honestly and early, then pivot immediately to transferable strengths.

**Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I haven't [specific thing JD requires]"
2. **Pivot:** "What I have done is [relevant accomplishment]"
3. **Connect:** "That's what draws me to this role: applying [strength] to [their need]"

**Example (Financial Services CTO, No Financial Background):**
"My background is building technology teams across healthcare and manufacturing - I haven't worked in financial services. What I have done is lead technology in highly regulated environments where compliance complexity (HIPAA, FDA) mirrors financial services (SEC, FINRA). I know how to build scalable secure platforms, manage strategic vendors, and deliver business value through technology. I can learn investment banking operations in months - technology leadership principles are universal."

**What Makes This Work:**
- Doesn't apologize or minimize the gap
- Acknowledges reality without dwelling on it
- Immediately pivots to transferable strengths
- Shows self-awareness and confidence
- Ends with forward momentum

================================================================================
## INTERVIEW STRATEGY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

### FAITH TECHNOLOGIES LEARNINGS (Updated Analysis)

**What Happened:**
- Applied for: Director of IT Business Partners role
- Interviewed through: Multiple rounds with peers and leadership
- Final Feedback: "My way or highway" / not servant leader
- Real Issue: Overqualified for App Manager level, peer felt threatened

**What Actually Occurred in Interviews:**
- Jeremy DID ask questions about their business
- Jeremy DID address "why less senior role"  
- Jeremy answered situational questions with genuine passion about leadership
- Jeremy shared "I like to grow organizations, I thrive in chaos"

**Why It Failed (Root Cause Analysis):**

1. **Ratio Problem:** Even though Jeremy asked questions, talked more than asked
2. **Energy Mismatch:** High passion when discussing own approach, flatter when asking about theirs
3. **Peer Threat Dynamic:** Would-be peer asked about taking less senior role
   - Heard: "This guy will outshine me and get promoted above me in 18 months"
   - Jeremy's answer confirmed their fear
4. **No Explicit Reassurance:** Didn't say "I'm here to collaborate with you, not compete"
5. **Sophistication Gap:** Asked questions they couldn't answer, highlighting organizational immaturity

**What VP Said (Decoded):**
"You have a lot of experience that could be helpful for 'knowing what good looks like' and where you could best fit in the organization"

**Translation:**
"You're too senior for App Manager. Maybe we could find you a Director or VP role if we have budget/scope."

**What to Do Differently:**

1. **Ask FIRST, Share SECOND (80/20 Rule):**
   - 80% of interview time asking them questions
   - 20% of interview time sharing your expertise
   - Track this explicitly during interview

2. **Equal Energy for Everything:**
   - Show same passion for understanding their approach
   - As passionate asking questions as answering them
   - Avoid energy differential that signals "my way is better"

3. **Address Overqualified Explicitly and Early:**
   "I know my resume shows VP-level experience at larger scale. You might wonder why I'm interested in [this role]. Here's why..." [then give genuine reasons specific to company]

4. **Reassure Potential Peers Directly:**
   "I'm excited to collaborate with [peer names]. I see us as partners - I make teammates look good, that's how I define my success."

5. **Show Vulnerability and Openness:**
   - Say "I don't know" or "I hadn't thought of that" when true
   - Ask "How have you approached that?" before offering your approach
   - Use "That's interesting" before "At my last company we..."

6. **Listen for Subtext:**
   When they ask "Why this role?" they're really asking "Will you leave in 12 months when you get bored?"

### GENERAL INTERVIEW PRINCIPLES

**For Roles Below Your Experience Level:**
Address it directly in opening conversation:
"I know you might be looking at my background wondering 'why is this person here for [lower-level role].' Let me be transparent about that..."

**For Industry Transitions:**
Lead with curiosity and learning mindset:
"I don't know [industry] deeply yet - that's part of what excites me. What I do know is [transferable skills]. I'd love to understand how [industry-specific challenge] works in your environment."

**For Gap Positioning:**
Use the 3-part framework:
1. Acknowledge gap honestly
2. Pivot to transferable strength
3. Connect to role needs

**For Collaborative Positioning:**
- Ask about their approach before sharing yours
- Build on what they say ("That makes sense because...")
- Use "we" language when discussing potential solutions
- Show genuine interest in their constraints/context

================================================================================
## COMPETENCIES BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

**BE SPECIFIC, NOT GENERIC:**

❌ **Generic (Keyword Stuffed):**
"Veterans Healthcare Systems, Cloud Platform Strategy, AI & Emerging Technology Strategy, DevSecOps, Zero Trust Security, Digital Transformation"

✅ **Specific (Grounded in Experience):**
"Healthcare IT Leadership, Cloud Platform Architecture (Salesforce, Snowflake), AI Strategy Development, Large-Scale Team Leadership (100+ influenced), Epic EMR Systems, Integration Architecture, Mission-Critical Systems, Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA, FDA)"

**Why the Second is Better:**
- Names specific technologies in parentheses
- Quantifies scale with numbers "(100+ influenced)"
- Avoids implying deep hands-on expertise in areas Jeremy understands conceptually
- Grounded in actual experience, not keyword stuffing from JD

**General Rule:**
- If you've used it hands-on → Name it specifically
- If you understand it strategically → Describe the context
- Never list something just because it's in the JD

**Examples of Specific vs Generic:**

Generic: "Cloud Architecture"
Specific: "Cloud Platform Architecture (Salesforce, Snowflake, SAP)"

Generic: "Team Leadership"
Specific: "Global Team Leadership (30+ professionals, 5+ countries)"

Generic: "Healthcare Technology"
Specific: "Healthcare IT Leadership (Epic EMR, HIPAA Compliance, 70K+ users)"

Generic: "AI Strategy"
Specific: "AI Strategy Development (GenAI, ML-powered optimization, vendor evaluation)"
