# CAREER NARRATIVE & POSITIONING INSIGHTS

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

This document captures positioning strategies, interview learnings, and context that informs resume creation but isn't purely factual data for Quick Reference.

================================================================================
## CRITICAL WORKFLOW LESSONS
================================================================================

### ALWAYS USE PROVEN LANGUAGE FROM PREVIOUS RESUMES

**The Problem (GDIT VA CTO v1):**
Agent 3 tried to keyword-stuff from JD instead of using proven language from `/tmp/molex_vp_data_ai_final.md`:
- Fabricated "AWS" (never used)
- Added "Google Cloud" to competencies (never mentioned)
- Keyword stuffing: "demonstrating rapid prototyping and translating emerging technology into business outcomes"
- Generic competencies: "Cloud Platform Strategy" instead of specific "(Salesforce, Snowflake)"
- Too direct with disability: "70% disabled" in summary

**The Fix (GDIT VA CTO v2):**
Agent 3 started over using Molex VP Data as voice/style template:
- Used exact proven phrasing: "Directed 3-month initiative with core AI team..."
- Removed ALL fabrications (AWS, Google Cloud)
- Specific competencies: "Cloud Platform Architecture (Salesforce, Snowflake)"
- Strategic disability positioning: "Army veteran" in summary only, removed 70% entirely
- Clean, direct language from proven template

**The Lesson:**
- Agent 3 MUST read `/tmp/` resumes before creating new ones
- Use proven language that already passed validation
- Don't keyword-stuff to match JD - use accurate, grounded language
- Reference CAREER_NARRATIVE.md for positioning strategies
- When in doubt, copy phrasing that already worked

## CORE POSITIONING STRATEGIES
================================================================================

### INDUSTRY TRANSITIONS = ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET

**The Pattern:**
- Healthcare (11 years) → Consulting (18 months) → Manufacturing (2.5 years) → Next?
- Each transition shows learning agility, not job hopping

**How to frame:**
"Technology is literally the same across everything industry - only 30% is industry-specific. I enter new domains, learn the mission, and deliver value. At Molex, I had zero manufacturing background but delivered $27M in value. At AAH, I learned healthcare IT and delivered $53M over 10 years."

**Key phrase:** "I like to grow organizations. I thrive in the grey area and chaos."

**Used successfully in:**
- Jabil resume (manufacturing → energy infrastructure transition)
- Direct Supply resume (manufacturing → senior living tech)

---

### VETERAN STATUS AS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**For VA/Veterans-focused roles:**
- 70% disabled Army veteran (2003-2006)
- 20 years as VA healthcare patient
- Understands VA frustrations from user perspective
- "I've lived the VA mission - I want to serve veterans through technology"

**Positioning (Updated Feb 2026 - GDIT VA CTO):**
"As an Army veteran who's used VA healthcare for 20 years, I understand veteran challenges from the patient side - and I want to serve them through technology leadership."

**DO NOT:**
- Put "70% disabled" in professional summary (too direct, not strategic)
- Include disability rating in Education section (not necessary for positioning)
- Lead with disability status

**DO:**
- "Army veteran" in summary is sufficient
- Emphasize 20 years as VA patient (shows lived experience)
- Focus on understanding veteran challenges from patient perspective
- Mission-driven language

**Why this works:**
- Most candidates have VA IT experience but NOT veteran lived experience
- Unique differentiator
- Mission-driven (not just job-seeking)

**Used in:**
- GDIT Veterans Healthcare CTO resume

**Proven summary language:**
"I've spent 17+ years building and leading technology organizations that deliver measurable outcomes for mission-critical healthcare systems. As an Army veteran who's used VA healthcare for 20 years, I understand veteran challenges from the patient side - and I want to serve them through technology leadership."

**Key elements:**
- "Army veteran" (not "70% disabled") in summary
- Keep 70% detail OUT of resume entirely (too direct, not strategic)
- Emphasize patient perspective understanding
- Mission-driven language

---

### LARGE-SCALE INFLUENCE VS DIRECT MANAGEMENT

**The Reality:**
- Direct management: 30+ at Molex (4 managers reporting), 10-15 at AAH
- Influenced/coordinated: 100+ at AAH (Infrastructure, Networking, Application Engineering)
- Total IT org: 1,000 → 1,700 post-merger at AAH

**How to position for 100+ team roles:**
"At Advocate Aurora Health, I influenced across Infrastructure, Networking, and Application Engineering teams of 100+ professionals to deliver enterprise-wide technology initiatives within a 1,000+ person IT organization."

**Why this matters:**
- When JD asks for "100+ team experience," can honestly claim influence at that scale
- Shows collaborative leadership without authority
- Demonstrates ability to operate in large, complex orgs

**Used in:**
- Direct Supply VP Engineering resume
- GDIT Veterans Healthcare CTO resume

---

### OVERQUALIFIED POSITIONING

**The Problem:**
When applying for roles below experience level (App Manager when you have VP-level experience), hiring teams worry:
- You'll get frustrated and leave
- You'll try to run the place
- You'll make current peers look bad

**How to address proactively:**
"I know my background shows VP-level experience and you might be wondering why I'm interested in [this role]. Here's the truth: I'm drawn to [Company]'s [mission/growth/technology]. I'd rather contribute at [Company] in a role where I can make immediate impact than chase a title somewhere else. I'm not here to remake your organization - I want to help execute YOUR vision."

**To peers specifically:**
"I'm here to collaborate with you, not compete. I see us as partners solving business problems together. I make my teammates look good."

**Lesson learned from:**
- Faith Technologies rejection (overqualified for App Manager, peer felt threatened)

---

### SERVANT LEADER VS "MY WAY OR HIGHWAY"

**The Challenge:**
Jeremy's direct communication style + passion + deep expertise can read as "I know the right way and I'll force it on you"

**What actually works:**
- Lead with curiosity, not solutions
- Ask "Tell me about your current approach" BEFORE sharing yours
- Acknowledge constraints: "Every company is different, I'd want to understand your context"
- Use collaborative language: "We could explore..." vs "I would do..."
- Show you'll LISTEN before you LEAD

**Interview approach:**
1. "Tell me about..." (ask first)
2. They talk (listen actively, build on what they say)
3. "That's interesting. At [Company] we tried something similar..." (share as comparison, not prescription)
4. "How have you handled [challenge]?" (stay curious)

**Avoid:**
- "The right approach is..."
- "Have you considered..." (implies they should have)
- "But..." (negates what came before)
- Jumping to solutions before understanding problems

**Order matters:**
- 80% asking / 20% telling = collaborative
- 20% asking / 80% telling = "my way or highway"

**Energy matters:**
- High energy when talking about YOUR approach + flat when asking about THEIRS = red flag
- Equal energy for curiosity and expertise sharing = collaborative

**Lesson learned from:**
- Faith Technologies final interview feedback

================================================================================
## PROVEN RESUME PHRASINGS
================================================================================

### ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET (Industry Transitions)

**Jabil Senior Director (manufacturing → energy infrastructure):**
"I've spent 17+ years leading technology teams with an entrepreneurial mindset - entering new industries, learning fast, and delivering value. I built a 30+ person global team at Molex despite no manufacturing background, recovering $27M through strategic technology leadership."

**Why it works:**
- Not defensive about industry gap
- Shows pattern of success across industries
- Emphasizes transferable leadership skills

---

### LARGE-SCALE INFLUENCE (100+ team roles)

**Direct Supply VP Engineering:**
"I've spent 17+ years building teams and driving business value in technology organizations ranging from 30 to 1,700 people. At Molex, I led 30+ global professionals while at Advocate Aurora Health I influenced across Infrastructure, Networking, and Application teams of 100+ engineers."

**Why it works:**
- Honest about direct vs influence
- Shows comfortable operating at large scale
- Demonstrates leadership without authority

---

### VETERAN MISSION (VA/Veterans roles)

**GDIT Veterans Healthcare CTO (Feb 2026 - FINAL VERSION):**
"I've spent 17+ years building and leading technology organizations that deliver measurable outcomes for mission-critical healthcare systems. As an Army veteran who's used VA healthcare for 20 years, I understand veteran challenges from the patient side - and I want to serve them through technology leadership."

**Why it works:**
- "Army veteran" sufficient (no disability rating needed)
- Emphasizes 20 years as VA patient
- Turns "no VA IT experience" gap into competitive advantage
- Shows genuine mission alignment
- Unique differentiator from other candidates

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't put "70% disabled" in summary (too direct)
- Don't include disability rating anywhere in resume (not strategic)

---

### AI STRATEGY (Accurate Scoping)

**Correct phrasing:**
"Developed AI operational strategy and 18-month implementation roadmap for commercial platforms, designing framework for embedding AI capabilities into Sales Operations, Pricing, and Commercial Excellence while maintaining central governance"

**What to avoid:**
- "Implemented AI transformation" (NOT true - only strategy)
- "Enterprise-wide AI" (scope was commercial platforms only)
- "Claude API" (NEVER - this was fabricated, actual tech: Snowflake + government APIs)
- "5 months" (was 3 months)

---

================================================================================
## INTERVIEW STRATEGY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

### FAITH TECHNOLOGIES LEARNINGS

**What happened:**
- Applied for App Manager (below VP level)
- Interviewed through multiple rounds
- Feedback: "My way or highway" / not servant leader
- Real issue: Overqualified, peer felt threatened

**What actually happened in interview:**
- Jeremy DID ask about their business
- Jeremy DID address "why less senior role"
- Jeremy answered situational questions with passion about leadership

**Why it failed:**
1. **Ratio problem:** Talked more than asked (even though asked questions)
2. **Energy mismatch:** High energy about own approach, lower when asking about theirs
3. **Peer threat:** Future peer asked about taking less senior role, felt Jeremy would outshine them
4. **No explicit reassurance:** Didn't say "I'm here to collaborate, not compete"

**What to do differently:**
1. **Ask FIRST, share SECOND:** 80/20 asking/telling ratio
2. **Equal energy:** Be as curious about their approach as passionate about yours
3. **Address overqualified explicitly:** "I know my resume shows [level] and you might wonder why I want [this role]..."
4. **Reassure peers:** "I'm here to collaborate with you, not compete. I make teammates look good."
5. **Show vulnerability:** Say "I don't know" or "I hadn't thought of that" when true

---

### FOR GDIT VETERANS HEALTHCARE CTO

**Unique positioning:**
- This IS Jeremy's level (CTO, $162K-$220K)
- Gap: No VA IT experience
- Advantage: 20 years as VA patient, 70% disabled veteran

**Strategy:**
- Lead with veteran story in summary
- Frame gap as understanding mission from user side
- Emphasize 10+ years healthcare IT leadership (AAH similar complexity to VA)
- Show rapid learning pattern (healthcare → manufacturing → VA next)

**What to emphasize:**
- Mission-driven (not just job seeking)
- Large-scale healthcare IT experience ($14B system)
- R&D/rapid prototyping (COVID app in 30 days)
- Executive communication (translating tech for non-technical stakeholders)
- Vendor management in complex environments

---

================================================================================
## FUTURE CAREER NARRATIVE
================================================================================

### WHERE JEREMY IS NOW (Feb 2026)

**Current state:**
- Unemployed since 08/2025
- Actively job searching (5-6 applications daily)
- Targeting: $300K-$500K+ range
- Open to: Remote, hybrid with monthly travel, onsite within commuting distance (Ixonia, WI)

**Exploring:**
- Traditional high-compensation executive roles (VP, SVP, C-level)
- Fractional/interim executive opportunities ($400K-$700K annually)
- Board positions (long-term goal)

---

### CAREER ARC STORY

**The through-line:**
"I've spent 17+ years building technology organizations that deliver measurable business outcomes. I believe in people-first leadership - building trust and psychological safety first, then shifting teams from order-taking to entrepreneurial thinking. Whether healthcare at AAH, manufacturing at Molex, or what's next, I enter new domains, learn the mission, and deliver value through strategic technology leadership."

**Why each transition made sense:**
- **AAH → Huron:** After 10 years, ready to learn consulting/advisory work
- **Huron → Molex:** Opportunity to build global team, new industry challenge
- **Molex → Next:** Laid off, but delivered VP-level outcomes, ready for right opportunity

**What's next:**
"I'm looking for an organization where I can apply my experience building teams, driving business value, and leading technology transformation. Whether it's healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, or another industry - technology leadership skills transfer. I want to work with a company that values people-first leadership and measurable business outcomes."

## NOTES FOR AGENT 3 (Draft Creator)
================================================================================

When creating tailored resumes:

1. **Reference previous successful resumes in /tmp/ for proven phrasing**
2. **Apply positioning strategies from this document based on role type:**
   - Industry transition? Use entrepreneurial mindset framing
   - 100+ team requirement? Use large-scale influence positioning
   - Veterans-focused? Lead with veteran story
   - Below experience level? Address overqualified proactively

3. **Use role context to inform why-left narratives if needed**

4. **Check proven phrasings section before creating new bullets**

5. **Apply interview insights when considering how hiring manager will read resume**

**This document evolves as we learn more through resume creation and interviews.**

================================================================================
## COMPETENCIES BEST PRACTICES (Updated Feb 2026)
================================================================================

**BE SPECIFIC, NOT GENERIC:**

❌ **Generic (GDIT v1):**
"Veterans Healthcare Systems, Cloud Platform Strategy, AI & Emerging Technology Strategy, DevSecOps, Zero Trust Security"

✅ **Specific (GDIT v2):**
"Healthcare IT Leadership, Cloud Platform Architecture (Salesforce, Snowflake), AI Strategy Development, Large-Scale Team Leadership (100+ influenced), Epic EMR Systems, Integration Architecture, Mission-Critical Systems, Regulatory Compliance"

**Why the second is better:**
- Names specific technologies in parentheses
- Quantifies "Large-Scale" with "(100+ influenced)"
- Avoids implying deep hands-on expertise in areas Jeremy understands conceptually (DevSecOps, Zero Trust)
- Grounded in actual experience, not keyword stuffing

**General rule:**
- If you've used it hands-on, name it specifically
- If you understand it strategically, describe the context
- Never list something just because it's in the JD
