## TIPS FOR FILLING THIS OUT:

### Quantify Everything Possible:
- Team sizes (direct reports, matrixed teams, global reach)
- Budget responsibility (annual operating budget, project budgets)
- Revenue impact (platforms supporting $XM revenue, deals worth $XM)
- Users impacted (employees using systems, customers served)
- Savings delivered (cost reduction, efficiency gains converted to dollars)
- Time saved (project accelerated by X months, process reduced by X%)
- Performance improvements (X% increase in adoption, X% reduction in incidents)

### Use Strong Leadership Language:
- Led, Directed, Managed, Built, Transformed, Championed, Established
- Avoid weak verbs: Helped, Assisted, Participated, Worked on

### Be Specific with Scope:
- Instead of "large team" → "30+ global professionals across 5 countries"
- Instead of "major budget" → "$5-10M annual P&L responsibility"
- Instead of "enterprise platform" → "Salesforce platform serving 1,200+ users across 8 departments"

### Focus on Business Outcomes:
- Technology is the HOW, business impact is the WHAT
- Every bullet should answer: "What business problem did this solve?"
- Connect technical work to revenue, cost savings, efficiency, or risk reduction

### Be Honest and Defensible:
- Only include what you can discuss in detail in an interview
- If you led a team that did something, say "Led team to..." not "Did..."
- If you were part of a team, be clear about your specific contribution

### Keep It Current:
- Update this file whenever you complete a major achievement
- Add new roles when you change jobs
- Refine bullets as you learn to articulate value better
