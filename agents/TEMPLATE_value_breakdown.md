# CUMULATIVE VALUE BREAKDOWN - INTERVIEW PREP

**PURPOSE:** This document helps you defend your total career value claim in interviews. When someone asks "You said $100M+ in value - walk me through that," you'll have the complete breakdown ready.

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Calculate and document YOUR value delivery. Be conservative. Only include what you can defend with specifics.

---

## TOTAL DOCUMENTED VALUE: $[YOUR TOTAL]

**Conservative Estimate:** $[Lower bound]
**Documented:** $[Mid-range - what you claim in resume]
**Potential Upside:** $[Upper bound if full value realized]

**Use the "Documented" number in your resumes.**

---

## HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR VALUE

### Value Categories (Pick What Applies):

**1. Cost Savings (Recurring)**
- Vendor contract renegotiations
- Platform consolidation
- Process automation
- Infrastructure optimization
- Licensing optimization
- Calculation: Annual savings × years realized = cumulative value

**2. Cost Savings (One-Time)**
- Prevented purchases
- Avoided implementations
- Datacenter consolidations
- M&A synergies
- Calculation: One-time savings = cumulative value

**3. Revenue Generation/Recovery**
- Sales enablement (attribute conservative %)
- Revenue leakage identified and recovered
- New revenue channels enabled
- Pricing optimization impact
- Calculation: Annual revenue impact × attribution % × years

**4. Efficiency Gains**
- Time saved through automation
- Process improvements
- Workflow optimizations
- Calculation: Hours saved × loaded labor rate × affected employees × years

**5. Risk Mitigation**
- Compliance violations avoided
- Security incidents prevented
- Downtime eliminated
- Calculation: Cost of risk × probability × value if prevented

## VALUE BREAKDOWN BY COMPANY

### [COMPANY 1 NAME]: $[TOTAL] Total

**Initiative 1: [Name]**
- **Value:** $[Amount]
- **Timeframe:** [Annual recurring × X years OR One-time OR Cumulative over X years]
- **Category:** [Cost savings / Revenue / Efficiency / Risk]
- **Calculation:** [Show your math]
  - Example: "$10M annual savings × 3 years deployment = $30M cumulative"
- **How to Defend:** [2-3 sentence explanation you'd give in interview]
  - Example: "We deployed AI-powered voice recognition to 5,000 physicians. Reduced documentation time by 2 hours per physician per week. At $150/hour loaded rate: 5,000 physicians × 2 hours/week × 50 weeks × $150 = $75M over 3-year contract, claimed $30M conservative."

**Initiative 2: [Name]**
- **Value:** $[Amount]
- **Timeframe:** [Annual/One-time/Cumulative]
- **Category:** [Type]
- **Calculation:** [Show math]
- **How to Defend:** [Explanation]

**Initiative 3: [Name]**
[Repeat structure]

## EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS (Reference Only)

### Example 1: Cost Optimization Initiative
**Dragon Medical Voice Recognition Deployment**
- **Value Claimed:** $30M cumulative
- **Calculation:** 
  - 5,000 physicians deployed
  - 2 hours saved per physician per week
  - $150/hour loaded physician rate
  - 3-year deployment/contract
  - Math: 5,000 × 2 hrs/week × 50 weeks/yr × $150/hr × 3 years = $225M theoretical
  - Conservative claim: $30M (13% of theoretical - accounts for adoption curve, training)
- **Defense:** "Conservative estimate. Even at 50% adoption and 1 hour saved, it's $37M. We claimed $30M to be safe."

### Example 2: Revenue Recovery
**Distributor Margin Analysis**
- **Value Claimed:** $27M annual
- **Calculation:**
  - Analyzed $500M distributor channel revenue
  - Identified 5-10% margin leakage on upsells
  - Company wasn't receiving share of distributor upsell margin
  - Recovered $27M annually in ongoing margin share
- **Defense:** "Built analytics identifying where distributors upsold Molex products but weren't sharing margin. Recovered ongoing revenue stream of $27M annually."

### Example 3: Efficiency Gains
**Mobile Application Deployment**
- **Value Claimed:** $800K cumulative
- **Calculation:**
  - 2,000 physicians using mobile app
  - 15 minutes saved per day per physician
  - $200/hour loaded physician rate
  - 4 years since deployment
  - Math: 2,000 × 0.25 hrs/day × 250 days/yr × $200/hr × 4 years = $10M theoretical
  - Conservative claim: $800K (8% of theoretical)
- **Defense:** "We see 80% daily active users saving conservative 10 minutes per day. Even this modest estimate over 4 years justified the investment."

## CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATION GUIDELINES

**General Rules:**
- Claim 10-30% of theoretical maximum value
- Account for adoption curves (not everyone uses it immediately)
- Account for training/ramp time
- Use loaded rates (salary + benefits), not just salary
- Document assumptions clearly

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Claiming 100% adoption on day one
- Not accounting for counterfactuals (would it have happened anyway?)
- Double-counting (same value attributed to multiple initiatives)
- Claiming credit for team's work without leadership attribution
- Using best-case scenarios instead of realistic

**Attribution Rules:**
- If you LED initiative → claim full value
- If you CONTRIBUTED to initiative → claim conservative % with context
- If your TEAM delivered → say "led team that delivered $X"
- If PLATFORM enabled → attribute reasonable % to platform (10-20%)

## INTERVIEW DEFENSE STRATEGY

### When Asked About Total Value:

**Step 1: Give The Total**
"I've delivered $[X]M+ in documented cumulative value across my career."

**Step 2: Break Down By Company**
"That breaks down to $[Y]M at Company A, $[Z]M at Company B, and $[W]M at Company C."

**Step 3: Offer Deep Dive**
"Happy to walk through any of these in detail. Which would be most relevant to what you're trying to understand?"

**Step 4: Pick Your Best Story**
[Be ready to explain your top 2-3 initiatives in detail with the calculation]

### When Someone Challenges A Number:

**Don't:**
- Get defensive
- Inflate on the spot
- Claim more than you documented
- Pretend it's exact science

**Do:**
- Show your conservative methodology
- Acknowledge it's an estimate
- Explain your assumptions
- Offer to walk through the math
- Emphasize you under-claimed vs theoretical max

**Example Response:**
"Great question. Let me show you how we calculated that. The theoretical maximum was actually $225M, but we claimed $30M because we used conservative adoption assumptions and only counted the first 3 years. Even if our assumptions were 50% off, it's still $15M."

## NOTES SECTION

[Use this space to document:]
- Sources of data (reports, systems, where numbers came from)
- Peer validation (did finance/business leaders confirm these numbers?)
- Conservative assumptions you made
- Alternative calculations you considered
- Any caveats or context needed

**Save this as `CUMULATIVE_VALUE_BREAKDOWN.md` after filling it out. Review before interviews. Update when you deliver new value.**
