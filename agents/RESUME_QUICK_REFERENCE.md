**DOCUMENTED VALUE:**

- Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud: 1,250+ internal users (Sales, CS, Pricing, Planning)
- B2B Commerce Cloud: $600M+ revenue, 70,000+ transactions, 6,000+ external customers

- Technology: Snowflake, government APIs, PDF/version history analysis
- Duration: 3 months (not 5 months)
- Scope: Commercial platforms (Sales Ops, Pricing, Commercial Excellence)
- Jeremy's role: Developed AI strategy, vision, 18-month roadmap
