================================================================================
## CRITICAL FACTS - 100% ACCURACY REQUIRED
================================================================================

## MOLEX (12/2022-08/2025)

**Title:** Sr. Manager, Digital CX, Global Sales & Marketing
**Company:** Molex LLC - $14B+ global manufacturer (Koch Industries subsidiary)
**Location:** Remote/Lisle, IL

**Team & Budget:**
- Team: 30+ global professionals across 5+ countries
- Reports: 4 direct manager reports
- Budget: $5-10M P&L responsibility

**KEY TERMINOLOGY (DO NOT DEVIATE):**
- "30+ global professionals" NOT "30 professionals globally"
- "Commercial Excellence and Pricing" = ONE team name (not two separate teams)
- "4x improvement" NOT "4x increase"
- "$14B+ global manufacturer" (use plus sign)

**DOCUMENTED VALUE:**
- Revenue Recovery: $27M annual ($20M distributor margin + $7M scrap tracking)
- Manufacturing Cloud: $15M+ annual projected (NEVER IMPLEMENTED - projection only)
- **Total Molex delivered value: $27M (NOT $42M)**
- **Can claim $35M+ if explicitly noting Manufacturing Cloud as "projected"**

**PLATFORMS:**
- Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud: 1,250+ internal users (Sales, CS, Pricing, Planning)
- B2B Commerce Cloud: $600M+ revenue, 70,000+ transactions, 6,000+ external customers
- Esker OCR: Email-to-order automation
- SAP ECC: Enterprise backbone
- PROS: Pricing platform
- NOT "Directed" B2B Commerce - use "Oversaw" or "Managed platforms"

**TARIFF/AI INITIATIVE (CRITICAL - FREQUENTLY FABRICATED):**

**CORRECT FACTS:**
- **Technology:** Snowflake (data platform), government APIs, PDF parsing, version history tracking
- **Duration:** 3 months (NOT 5 months)
- **Scope:** Commercial platforms only (Sales Operations, Pricing, Commercial Excellence)
- **Jeremy's Role:** Developed AI strategy, vision, 18-month implementation roadmap, some solution architecting
- **Team Role:** Team built the actual solution
- **Status:** Strategy completed, handed to team for implementation
- **Value:** Supports $14B+ annual revenue (tariff compliance risk mitigation)

**WHAT TO NEVER SAY:**
❌ "Claude API" - This was completely fabricated, never used
❌ "Deployed GenAI solution" - Only developed strategy, didn't deploy
❌ "Built HTS classification system" - Team built it, not Jeremy
❌ "5 months" - Was only 3 months
❌ "Enterprise-wide AI" - Was commercial platforms only

**CORRECT PHRASING OPTIONS:**

**Option 1 (Strategy Focus):**
"Developed AI operational strategy directing GenAI solution for HTS tariff classification using Snowflake, government APIs, and version-controlled regulatory data, establishing automated analysis capability supporting $14B+ annual revenue"

**Option 2 (Detailed):**
"Directed 3-month initiative with core AI team developing operational delivery model and 18-month implementation roadmap. Designed framework for embedding AI capabilities into commercial product teams (Sales Operations, Pricing, Commercial Excellence) while maintaining central governance."

**Option 3 (Architecture Focus):**
"Architected AI strategy for automated tariff classification using Snowflake data platform integrated with government APIs and PDF parsing, designing solution framework for cross-functional team to implement"

**Key Points:**
- Jeremy provided: Vision, strategy, some solution architecture, then handed off
- Technology stack: Snowflake connects to APIs, parses PDFs/version history, matches to SAP material master
- Salesforce promoted this as out-of-box (they lied - had to build everything)
- Use "developed strategy" or "directed initiative" NOT "deployed" or "implemented"

## CUMULATIVE VALUE BREAKDOWN

**TOTAL DOCUMENTED VALUE: $100M+ (Conservative: $95M)**

### MOLEX: $27M Annual Delivered

**Delivered (Documented):**
1. **Revenue Recovery: $27M annual**
   - Distributor Margin Compliance: $20M annual
   - Scrap/Obsolete Tracking: $7M annual
   - Platform: SAP analytics and business intelligence

**Projected (NOT Implemented):**
2. **Manufacturing Cloud: $15M+ annual projected**
   - Inventory management optimization
   - Supply chain visibility improvements
   - **Status:** Business case approved, never implemented before layoff

**How to Use in Resumes:**
- Conservative claim: "$27M delivered" or "$35M+ value" (if noting projection)
- Accurate detailed: "$27M in revenue recovery + $15M projected (Manufacturing Cloud)"
- Never claim: "$42M delivered" (this includes unimplemented projections)

### AAH: $53M Cumulative (10-year tenure)

1. **Dragon Medical 360: $30M cumulative** ($10M/year × 3 years)

**Interview Defense:**
"The $53M at AAH includes both one-time transformation projects and annualized savings over my 10-year tenure. For example, the EAP application saved $800K annually for 4 years. When you're at an organization for a decade, those annual savings compound into significant cumulative value."

## NEVER FABRICATE - COMMON FABRICATIONS TO AVOID

**Things that have been fabricated in previous resume attempts:**

❌ **"Claude API" for tariff solution**
   - Reality: Snowflake + government APIs + PDF parsing
   
❌ **"$42M delivered at Molex"**
   - Reality: $27M delivered + $15M projected (never implemented)

❌ **"Deployed AI solution" or "Implemented AI"**
   - Reality: Developed strategy, team implemented
   
❌ **"Enterprise-wide AI strategy"**
   - Reality: Scoped to commercial platforms only
   
❌ **"Leading 100+ engineers directly"**
   - Reality: Influenced 100+, directly managed 10-15

❌ **"5 months AI initiative"**
   - Reality: 3 months
   
❌ **"70,000+ workforce for COVID screening"**
   - Reality: 40,000+ healthcare workforce (70K is total employees)

❌ **"AWS" or "Google Cloud" experience**
   - Reality: Salesforce, Snowflake, SAP - not AWS/GCP

❌ **"CIO" or "VP" titles**
   - Reality: Sr. Manager at Molex, Program Director at AAH

**If uncertain about ANY detail:** ASK USER before including in resume.
**When user corrects a fact:** Update immediately, believe them, move forward.
